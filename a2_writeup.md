# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
Attempting to work on question 2 before Mr. Berg showed the correct solution was definitely that hardest part of the function. I had to search up the .join() function to even return a value that worked. Mr. Berg also showed the .append() function which was also necessary. Aside from that, thinking about how to do this logically was fairly simple, the problem was converting that into a code format. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
The match function could definitely be utilized to extract information. When given a prompt such as "What movies were directed by Federico Fellini?," you could grab the verb part "directed by" and the name to return the user an answer that would help them find movies that were directed by that person. Depending on the change to the phrase, they can be given other film directors or different movies. There is a lot of use from this function
